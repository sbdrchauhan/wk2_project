This is a week2 of the Corise: Python for Data Science course project. Here, we learned about pandas library. We got to learn how to inspect dataframe, look into the data types and columns, see if the values in columns matches to its intended data types, if not then mutate columns using map, groupby, etc. Finally, after cleaning, we need to merge two dataframes for final complete dataframe.

The completed/cleaned dataframe is then used to create an app using Streamlit, where we can filter dataframe changing the values of the columns/variables. This helps to quickly overview the dataframe with various filtering conditions as we desire.

The app can be found here.
